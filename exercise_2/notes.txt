* Create a program that fills an array of 1.000.000 elements with the tangent value of the integers between [1 , 1.000.000].

* Then, calculate the sum of the array by creating five threads, each obtaining the sum of a segment of the array and returning the result. 

* The main thread should collect the results from all the threads and compute the total sum.

* Compare the computing times using threads and performing all the operations in the main program.
